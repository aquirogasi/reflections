What happens when you initialize a repository? An empty directory is created
Why do you need to do it?

 To start a project where all the files can be tracked together
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

Working directory: File in your local computer, Staging: Area where you modify the code before to commit  
What value do you think it offers?

 Staging area allows the programer to modify the code in a test mode before to commit
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
Every time I have a logical change I add the code to staging to be commited 
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized?

How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?


Through the diagram you can identify how the branches are related to the main course of the code's changes (master) and evaluate possible merges 
What is the result of merging two branches together? 
Merging two branches will result in the union of their commit's histories
Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

To distinguish the logical merges 
What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
Automatic merge saves time, but it's not perfect.
Manual merge will take more time, but less risk of generating error in the resulting code
